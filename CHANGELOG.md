## 2025-10-05 - High-Level Client Implementation ✅

### /test and /report Complete
- Fixed Psalm #[Override] attribute warnings (auto-fixed)
- All 51 unit tests passing with 78 assertions
- Full QA suite passes: PHP-CS-Fixer ✅, PHPStan ✅, Psalm ✅, PHPUnit ✅
- Updated TODO.md to mark all tasks complete
- All phases (1-6) successfully completed

### Added
- **High-level convenience client** for common RAG operations
  - `Ragie\Client` - Main entry point with simple `retrieve()` method
  - `Ragie\RetrievalOptions` - Fluent builder for retrieval parameters (topK, filter, rerank, etc.)
  - `Ragie\RetrievalResult` - Convenient wrapper for retrieval responses with helper methods
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 51 unit tests covering all functionality
- **Working examples** demonstrating basic and advanced usage
  - `examples/retrieve.php` - Basic retrieval example
  - `examples/retrieve_advanced.php` - Advanced options and filters

### Features
- Fluent interface for building retrieval options
- Immutable options pattern for safe method chaining
- Lazy initialization of API instances
- Type-safe with full PHP 8.1+ support
- Implements Countable interface on RetrievalResult
- Escape hatches to underlying generated API for advanced use cases
- Comprehensive PHPDoc with inline examples

### Quality Assurance
- PHP-CS-Fixer: ✅ All files properly formatted
- PHPStan level 9: ✅ No errors
- PHPUnit: ✅ 51/51 tests passing (78 assertions)
- Test coverage focuses on all public APIs and edge cases

### Documentation
- Detailed implementation plan in PLAN.md
- Flat task list in TODO.md
- Inline code examples in all classes
- Working examples for common use cases

### Notes
- Focused on retrieval operations (most common RAG task)
- Document management remains in generated client (`getDocumentsApi()`)
- Response generation intentionally excluded from V1 (accessible via `getResponsesApi()`)
- All wrapper code preserves full access to generated client

## 2024-07-06
- Realigned repository scope to inference-focused retrieval/response helpers and updated PLAN/TODO accordingly.
- Refreshed Composer scaffolding (metadata, scripts, autoload) and excluded generated code from php-cs-fixer runs.
- Upgraded PHPUnit configuration to 10.x schema and ensured QA pipeline runs via `./test.sh`.
- Tests: `./test.sh` (composer install, composer lint, composer stan, composer psalm, composer test) ✅

## 2024-07-05
- Ran /test workflow; skipped because project lacks `composer.json` and associated test suite.
- Verified via /report run that automated tests remain unavailable pending composer scaffolding.
- Configured OpenAPI generator to use local spec with Ragie namespaces, added checksum tracking, and refreshed regeneration workflow.
- Created Composer package scaffolding, QA tooling configs, dependency log, and baseline unit tests (`composer test`).
- Established lint (`composer lint`), static analysis (`composer stan`, `composer psalm`), and full QA automation (`./test.sh`).
