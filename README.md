# Ragie PHP API Client

This is a PHP client for the [Ragie AI](https://ragie.ai/) API. It provides a convenient way to interact with the Ragie AI services for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

This client is automatically generated by [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) based on the official Ragie AI OpenAPI specification. The source code for the generated client is located in the `src/Ragie/Api` directory.

## Installation

You can install the client using Composer.

```bash
composer require ragie/ragie-php
```

(Note: This assumes the package is available on Packagist. If you are using it from a local source, you may need to configure your `composer.json` accordingly.)

## Usage

### Low-Level API Client

The generated client provides a direct mapping to the Ragie AI API endpoints.

First, configure your API key:

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

// Configure API key authorization: bearerAuth
$config = Ragie\Api\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('Authorization', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = Ragie\Api\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('Authorization', 'Bearer');

$apiInstance = new Ragie\Api\Api\DocumentsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->listDocuments();
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling DocumentsApi->listDocuments: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

### High-Level Client (Planned)

To make common RAG operations more convenient, a higher-level client is planned. This client will provide simplified methods for tasks like adding documents, retrieving information, and asking questions. See `PLAN.md` for more details.
