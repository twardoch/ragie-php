# Work Log

## 2024-07-05
- Executed /test workflow; repository lacks composer scaffolding so no automated PHP tests could run yet.
- Noted need to add composer metadata and test tooling to enable future test runs.
- Per /report checklist, re-reviewed PLAN/TODO and confirmed no completed tasks to remove.

### Current iteration focus
- Mirror OpenAPI generator configuration to local spec and Ragie namespaces.
- Update regeneration script, add checksum tracking, and document workflow steps.
- Establish root Composer package metadata with required runtime and dev dependencies.
- Add repository hygiene files (.editorconfig, .gitattributes, QA configs, test.sh) and scaffold dependency documentation.

### Progress notes
- Added OpenAPI generator configuration, checksum tracking, and regeneration script updates.
- Scaffolded Composer package metadata, QA tooling configs, and dependency documentation.
- Installed dev dependencies and wrote baseline tests verifying generator assets.
- `composer test` (PHPUnit 10.5.58) ✅

#### Ragie API regeneration workflow
1. Fetch the latest `openapi.json` from https://api.ragie.ai/openapi.json and overwrite the local file.
2. Run `./build_generatapi.sh` to regenerate code, refresh `openapi.sha256`, and stamp `src/Ragie/Api/.regen-stamp`.
3. Inspect the diff under `src/Ragie/Api/lib` and commit alongside the updated checksum and stamp.
- `composer lint` ✅
- `composer stan` ✅
- `composer psalm` ✅
- `./test.sh` ✅ (runs install + lint + stan + psalm + phpunit)

#### Risk assessment
- Low: Build script and checksum updates affect regeneration workflow only; runtime code untouched until regeneration occurs.
- Low: Composer scaffolding introduces dependencies but no production code changes yet; tests guard configuration.
- Low: QA tooling configs excluded generated sources to avoid noise; revisit when high-level SDK arrives.
