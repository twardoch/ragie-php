The folder @./src/Ragie/Api contains the `https://api.ragie.ai/openapi.json` ( @./openapi.json )API client automatically generated by `openapi-generate` (using @./build.sh ). 

@./llms.txt contains a single-file snapshot of the codebase.

1. Into @README.md write an informative description of the project. 
2. Into @PLAN.md write a detailed plan that explains to a junior developer how we can into @./src/Ragie also write a more convenient way to use the API client for most common RAG operations. 
3. Into @TODO.md write a list of tasks that need to be completed to implement the plan. 


@llms.txt contains a single-file snapshot of the codebase. Write a detailed plan that explains to a junior developer how, in addition to the automated client code, we can into @./src/Ragie also write a more convenient way to use the API client for most common RAG operations. @PLAN.md already contains 3 different proposals, but theyâ€™re just sketches. I want a truly extensive, detailed, comprehensive fully actionable plan that is a detailed guide for a junior developer to implement the additional convenience code.
