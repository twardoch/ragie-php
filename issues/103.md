The folder @src/Ragie/Api contains a PHP client automatically generated by @build_generatapi.sh (which uses `openapi-generate`) for the Ragie API —— see @openapi.json

We never manually edit the generated client; it stays sacred: everything under src/Ragie/Api must only ever change via ./build_generatapi.sh 

Our goal is to provide a thin but expressive high-level layer inside @src/Ragie which works IN ADDITION (and on top of) the generated client, and provides simple convenient access to COMMON RAG flows: run retrievals & read responses. Other 'admin' RAG flows like ingesting documents etc. should still only be accessible through the generated client.

So high-level layer should be in @src/Ragie, and should use the generated client from the 'Api' subfolder. 

Think hard and /plan : into @PLAN.md write a detailed description that explains to a junior developer how we can implement the high-level layer. It should devise specific APIs and write code snippets. Remember: we just want a few simple convenience methods that wrap around the generated client, for the most-common RAG tasks. 

Then into @TODO.md write a flat - [ ] prefixed list of tasks that need to be completed to implement the plan.

And then think hard and /work on implementing the plan.
